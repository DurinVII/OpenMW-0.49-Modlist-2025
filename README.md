# OpenMW-0.49-Modlist-2025
My modlist for OpenMW 0.49 

A full list of mods I use for my OpenMW 0.49 dev version. OpenMW is an open source engine for Morrowind.
Download the OpenMW Engine here: https://openmw.org/ (original Morrowind copy required)

This list, altough it gives the list of mods, does not givbe them in the load order. Since quite a few mods have different options and versions which you may want to customize, our load orders may differ, which is why I opted to not include it.

Most mods are from NexusMods and have been installed with Mod Organizer 2.

Any changes will be written here.

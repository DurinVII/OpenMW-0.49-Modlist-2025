# OpenMW-0.49-Modlist-2025
My modlist for OpenMW 0.49 

A full list of mods I use for my OpenMW 0.49 dev version. OpenMW is an open source engine for Morrowind. Using the 0.49 engine, mod creaters can get even more creative than before, making mods that could not be made for the vanilla engine. 
Such mods can be found in this modpack, examples being Dynamic Actors and Animated Containers...

This list, altough it gives the list of mods, does not put them in order. Since quite a few mods have different options and versions which you may want to customize, adding a load order would be pointless.

Any changes will be written here.

# OpenMW-0.49-Modlist-2025
My modlist for OpenMW 0.49 

A full list of mods I use for my OpenMW 0.49 dev version. OpenMW is an open source engine for Morrowind.
Download the OpenMW Engine here: https://openmw.org/ (original Morrowind copy required)

This list, altough it gives the list of mods, does not put them in order. Since quite a few mods have different options and versions which you may want to customize, I'm not adding the load order here.
Most mods are from NexusMods and have been installed with Mod Organizer 2.

Any changes will be written here.
